      <h1>
        Jason wakes up in a mysterious world of magic and monsters. He’ll face
        off against cannibals, cultists, wizards, monsters, and that’s just the
        first day. He’s going to need courage, he’s going to need wit and he’s
        going to need some magic powers of his own. But first, he’s going to
        need pants.
        <br />
        <br />
        Follow Jason as he makes a place for himself in a world that is strange,
        yet sometimes strangely familiar. He’ll meet crime lords and
        aristocrats, gods and monsters on his path from would-be victim to
        heroic adventurer. At least, he tries to be heroic. It’s hard to be good
        when all your powers are evil.

              "Jason wakes up in a mysterious world of magic and monsters. He’ll face
              off against cannibals, cultists, wizards, monsters, and that’s just the
              first day. He’s going to need courage, he’s going to need wit and he’s
              going to need some magic powers of his own. But first, he’s going to
              need pants.
              <br />
              <br />
              Follow Jason as he makes a place for himself in a world that is strange,
              yet sometimes strangely familiar. He’ll meet crime lords and
              aristocrats, gods and monsters on his path from would-be victim to
              heroic adventurer. At least, he tries to be heroic. It’s hard to be good
              when all your powers are evil."
